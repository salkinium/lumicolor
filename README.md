Luminet2 Demonstrator
=====================

The [Luminet2 Smart Pixel][luminet2], developed by [The Media Computing Group][i10], can be used as a stand alone color LED or integrated into more complex communication networks.

This project gives you a starting point of how to use the Smart Pixel with the microcontroller library [xpcc.io][], with support for the color LED, light sensor and serial communication protocols.

Also see my other project with the Pixels, [The Textile Display][].

Organisation
------------

This repository is organized as follows:

-	The *software* folder contains the embedded software for the pixel.

The Luminet2 Smart Pixel was designed by [Mariana Bocoi][bocoi].  
The embedded software and communication protocol was designed by [Niklas Hauser][hauser].
